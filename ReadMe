Note 1: Sequention execution on KNL was taking very long time so
	I could not put it to the speedup graph. This should be due 
	to individually weak cores of KNL. Speedup until 256 threads
	is making sense for this reason. 

Node 2: Execution with 100K points was taking very long time on my
	desktop so I used 10K points for i5 speedup graph. Speedup until
	4 threads is making sense with the 2 hardware threaded dual cores
	of intel i5-5257.

Node 3: The data to be used to draw 3D graph was generated with the
	previous version of the code so results of the submitted code 
	might not exactly match but would show the behavior of the 
	high dimensional data better.
